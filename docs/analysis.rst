An overview
===========
Automated data analysis of an EEXE simulation is allowed by the CLI :code:`analyze_EEXE`, which
share the same input YAML file as the CLI :code:`run_EEXE`. Relevant parameters specified in the YAML
file for data analysis can be found in this section: :ref:`doc_analysis_params`.

- Analysis based on transitions between replicas
- Analysis based on transitions between states
- Analysis based on Markov state models
- Free energy calculations
