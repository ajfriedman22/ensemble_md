    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how one can launch a REXEE simulation for a toy system using the CLI `run_REXEE` implemented in the python package `ensemble_md`. Here, our test system is molecule composed of four interaction sites in a box of water molecules. In the next tutorials, we will demonstrate how to analyze the output of the simulation, including the calculation of the solvation free energy of the molecule. For a more comprehensive understanding, we strongly recommend reading our [documentation](https://ensemble-md.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simulations.html) on launching REXEE simulations before starting this tutorial. The tutorial can be run on binder (without installation of anything) by clicking the badge above. "

    "In our case, the system of interest is a linear model composed of 4 interaction sites, where the first and last atom have a charge of +0.2 and -0.2, respectively. In `expanded.mdp`, we define 9 alchemical states in total to decouple the van der Waals interactions and coulombic interactions. Our goal is to run an ensemble composed of 4 replicas of expanded ensemble, each of which sample 6 alchemical states, with the shift between adjacent replicas being 1 state. That is, we want replicas 0 to 3 to sample states 0 to 6, 1 to 7, 2 to 8, and 3 to 9, respectively. Each replica will be performed for 5 iterations, with the length of each iteration being 500 steps (i.e. 1 ps). We will use the Metropolis MC scheme to swap replicas, and use exponential averaging with histogram correction for combining weights of exchanging replicas. The histogram cutoff will be set as 1000 to avoid overcorrection and we will swap 2 pairs of replicas in each attempt when possible. All STDOUT will be redirected to `results.txt`. "
