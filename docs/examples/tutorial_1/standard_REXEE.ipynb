    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how one can use different command-line interfaces (CLIs) implemented in the Python package `ensemble_md` to prepare, perform, and analyze a fixed-weight REXEE simulation to estimate the solvation free energy of a toy molecule composed of 4 interaction sites. For a more comprehensive understanding, we strongly recommend reading our [documentation](https://ensemble-md.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simulations.html) on launching REXEE simulations before starting this tutorial. With MPI (`mpirun` or `mpiexec`), GROMACS and `ensemble_md` all installed, you should be able to run this tutorial either locally or on a HPC cluster, as long as you have at least four CPU cores. Alternatively, you can click the badge above to run this tutorial on Binder without installing anything. Notably, this tutorial assumes that you understand the basics of the expanded ensemble method and relevant simulation parameters in GROMACS. If not, we recommend reading the [GROMACS documentation]() and/or [this tutorial](). "

    "While you could use multiple GRO and TOP files, one for each replica in a REXEE simulation, in this tutorial, we will use the same GRO and TOP files for all replicas to keep the demonstration straightforward. As for the MDP template `expanded.mdp`, it can be inspected that it adopts common/typical settings for a fixed-weight EE simulation, with 9 alchemical intermediate states defined to decouple van der Waals interactions and coulombic interactions. During the REXEE simulation, customized MDP files will be generated for different replicas such that the MDP file for each replica only consider the set of states that the replica is constrained to. Notably, the weights specified via the parameter `init_lambda_weights` were obtained from a weight-updating EE simulation. If you would like to run a weight-updating REXEE simulation, simply use an MDP file for running a weight-updating EE simulation, i.e., and MDP file without `init_lambda_weights` being specified, and with options such as `wl_scale`, `wl_ratio`, `init_wl_delta`, `lmc_stats`, `lmc_weights_equil`, `weight_equil_wl_delta` specified.\n",

With the total number of states as 9 and a state shift of 1, this means that replicas 0, 1, 2, 3 are constrained to sampling states 0-5, 1-6, 2-7, and 3-8, respectively. The simulation will attempt to swap coordinates between replicas every 500 integration steps, and perform 5 iterations in total. (Note that generally we need a much larger number of iterations.
