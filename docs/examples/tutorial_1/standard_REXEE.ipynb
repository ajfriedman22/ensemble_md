    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how one can use the different command-line interfaces (CLIs) implemented in the Python package `ensemble_md` to prepare, perform, and analyze a REXEE simulation to estimate the solvation free energy of a toy molecule composed of 4 interaction sites. For a more comprehensive understanding, we strongly recommend reading our [documentation](https://ensemble-md.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simulations.html) on launching REXEE simulations before starting this tutorial. With MPI (`mpirun` or `mpiexec`), GROMACS and `ensemble_md` all installed, you should be able to run this tutorial either locally or on a HPC cluster, as long as you have at least four CPU cores. Alternatively, you can click the badge above to run this tutorial on Binder without installing anything. Notably, this tutorial assumes that you understand the basics of the expanded ensemble (EE) method and relevant simulation parameters in GROMACS. If not, we recommend reading the [GROMACS documentation](https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/algorithms/expanded-ensemble.html) and/or [this tutorial](https://weitsehsu.com/course/advanced_sampling/exe/).

    "In methods such as expanded ensembles or REXEE, where each alchemical state has an associated weight (see [here](https://ensemble-md.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simulations.html)), it is common to use a two-stage protocol for alchemical free energy calculations. Specifically, this protocol is composed of the following two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **weight-updating stage**: In a weight-updating stage, the weights of the different states are constantly updated until convergence during the simulation, usually by methods such as the Wang-Landau algorithm or its $1/t$ variant. The purpose of this stage is to obtain weights that could flatten out the free energy surface along the alchemical direction such that all states have a roughly equal chance to be visited in the next stage, i.e., the fixed-weight stage. \n",
    "- A **fixed-weight stage**: In a fixed-weight stage, the weights of different alchemical states are fixed at predefined values usually converged in a weight-updating stage. Unlike weight-updating simulations, a fixed-weight simulation is in equilibrium, and can therefore be analyzed by free energy estimators that require equilibrium data for free energy calculations, such as TI, BAR, MBAR, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this protocol, one can use a weight-updating EE/REXEE simulation followed by a fixed-weight EE/REXEE simulation. In our [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00484), we have compared EE and REXEE methods in both weight-updating and fixed-weight phases comprehensively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, this tutorial will only focus on fixed-weight REXEE simulations, with the weights provided by a weight-updating EE simulation not shown here. A weight-updating REXEE simulation can be performed simply by using the same workflow for running fixed-weight REXEE simulations, with input MDP files replaced by the ones for weight-updating EE simulations."
