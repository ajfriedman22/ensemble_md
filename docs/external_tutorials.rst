External tutorials
==================
Since the REXEE method combines the working principles of expanded ensemble and Hamiltonian replica exchange methods, understanding
these two methods, espeically how to run them in GROMACS, could be helpful for understanding and using the REXEE method. Here, 
we provide a list of external tutorials about the expanded ensemble and Hamiltonian replica exchange methods.
