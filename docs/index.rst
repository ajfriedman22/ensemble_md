Welcome to ensemble_md's documentation!
=========================================================
``ensemble_md`` is a Python package providing methods for running 
GROMACS simulation ensembles, including ensemble of expanded ensemble 
and ensemble of alchemical metadynamics. The former is our main focus 
in our current phase, while the latter will be under development in 
the future.
